### Hi! I'm Ammon . 

## I am a software engineer who is passionate about creating products that users love. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS and PostgreSQL. I recently completed a 12-week intensive full-stack software engineering bootcamp with General Assembly. Now I'm working on some passion projects while finding the right job to continue developing my skills!
